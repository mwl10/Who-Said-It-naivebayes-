The code that followed alongside the part B analysis and write up (I PUT IT HERE INSTEAD OF RECORDING THE SHELL SESSION) was written at the bottom of the who-said-it-naive-bayes.py file (where we built the classifier in part a). The accuracy file contains the accuracies of the classifier before and after the random seed was fixed. The who-said-it-partb-write-up.pdf contains all the responses for part b's write up & analysis.
